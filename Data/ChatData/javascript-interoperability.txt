# JavaScript Interoperability
## Description
Blazor supports JavaScript interop for integrating with JavaScript libraries.

## Resolution
To resolve JavaScript interop issues:
1. Use `IJSRuntime` for JavaScript calls.
2. Handle JavaScript errors using exception handling.
3. Debug JavaScript interop using browser tools.
4. Test JavaScript interop functionality using unit tests.

For more details, refer to the official Blazor JavaScript interop documentation.
