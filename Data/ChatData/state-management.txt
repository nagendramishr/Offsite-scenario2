# State Management
## Keywords
state management, state-management

## Description
State management in Blazor can be achieved using cascading parameters, services, or external libraries like Fluxor.

## Resolution
To resolve state management issues:
1. Use cascading parameters for parent-child communication.
2. Inject services for shared state across components.
3. Use `IObservable` or `EventCallback` for reactive state.
4. Debug state changes using logging.

For more details, refer to the official Blazor state management documentation.
