## Description
Blazor provides built-in support for form validation using `EditForm` and validation attributes.

## Resolution
To resolve form validation issues:
1. Use `DataAnnotations` for model validation.
2. Implement custom validation logic using `ValidationMessage`.
3. Debug validation errors using browser tools.
4. Use third-party libraries for advanced validation scenarios.

For more details, refer to the official Blazor form validation documentation.
