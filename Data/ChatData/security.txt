# Security
## Description
Blazor applications can be secured using authentication, authorization, and secure data handling.

## Resolution
To resolve security issues:
1. Use `AuthenticationStateProvider` for user authentication.
2. Implement role-based authorization using `AuthorizeView`.
3. Secure sensitive data using encryption.
4. Validate user inputs to prevent attacks.

For more details, refer to the official Blazor security documentation.
