# Testing
## Description
Blazor supports testing using unit tests and integration tests.

## Resolution
To resolve testing issues:
1. Use `TestContext` for unit tests.
2. Mock services using `Moq`.
3. Debug test failures using logging.
4. Test UI components using `bUnit`.

For more details, refer to the official Blazor testing documentation.
