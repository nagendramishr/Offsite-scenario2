# SignalR
## Description
Blazor supports real-time communication using SignalR.

## Resolution
To resolve SignalR issues:
1. Use `HubConnection` for client-server communication.
2. Handle connection lifecycle events (`OnConnected`, `OnDisconnected`).
3. Debug SignalR issues using browser tools.
4. Test SignalR functionality using unit tests.

For more details, refer to the official Blazor SignalR documentation.
