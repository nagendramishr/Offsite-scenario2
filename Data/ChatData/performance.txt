# Performance
## Description
Blazor applications can be optimized for performance by reducing rendering overhead and minimizing network calls.

## Resolution
To resolve performance issues:
1. Use `ShouldRender` to control rendering.
2. Optimize data binding with `@bind`.
3. Cache data to reduce network calls.
4. Use `Virtualize` for large lists.

For more details, refer to the official Blazor performance documentation.
