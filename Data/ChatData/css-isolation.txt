# CSS Isolation
## Description
Blazor supports CSS isolation for components using `.razor.css` files.

## Resolution
To resolve CSS isolation issues:
1. Use `.razor.css` files for component-specific styles.
2. Debug CSS issues using browser tools.
3. Avoid global styles that conflict with isolated styles.
4. Test CSS isolation using unit tests.

For more details, refer to the official Blazor CSS isolation documentation.
