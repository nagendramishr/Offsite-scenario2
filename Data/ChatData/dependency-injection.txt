# Dependency Injection
## Description
Blazor provides built-in support for dependency injection using the `@inject` directive.

## Resolution
To resolve dependency injection issues:
1. Register services in `Program.cs` using `AddScoped`, `AddSingleton`, or `AddTransient`.
2. Use `@inject` to inject services into components.
3. Debug injection issues using logging.
4. Avoid circular dependencies in service registration.

For more details, refer to the official Blazor dependency injection documentation.
