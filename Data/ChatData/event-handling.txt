# Event Handling
## Description
Blazor supports event handling using the `@on` directive.

## Resolution
To resolve event handling issues:
1. Use `@onClick`, `@onInput`, and other directives for event binding.
2. Pass event arguments using `EventCallback`.
3. Debug event handling using browser tools.
4. Avoid heavy computations in event handlers.

For more details, refer to the official Blazor event handling documentation.
