# Logging
## Description
Blazor supports logging using the `ILogger` interface.

## Resolution
To resolve logging issues:
1. Inject `ILogger` into components and services.
2. Use different log levels (`Trace`, `Debug`, `Information`, `Warning`, `Error`, `Critical`).
3. Debug logging issues using browser tools.
4. Configure logging in `Program.cs`.

For more details, refer to the official Blazor logging documentation.
