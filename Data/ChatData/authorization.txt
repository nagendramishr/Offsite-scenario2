# Authorization
## Description
Blazor supports role-based and policy-based authorization using `AuthorizeView`.

## Resolution
To resolve authorization issues:
1. Use `AuthorizeView` for conditional rendering based on roles.
2. Define policies in `Program.cs`.
3. Debug authorization issues using logging.
4. Test authorization rules using unit tests.

For more details, refer to the official Blazor authorization documentation.
