# Authentication
## Description
Blazor supports authentication using `AuthenticationStateProvider` and external identity providers.

## Resolution
To resolve authentication issues:
1. Use `AuthenticationStateProvider` for managing user authentication.
2. Configure external identity providers in `Program.cs`.
3. Debug authentication issues using logging.
4. Test authentication flows using unit tests.

For more details, refer to the official Blazor authentication documentation.
