# Data Binding
## Description
Blazor supports two-way data binding using the `@bind` directive.

## Resolution
To resolve data binding issues:
1. Ensure the property has both `get` and `set` accessors.
2. Use `@bind-Value` for specific input types.
3. Debug binding issues using browser tools.
4. Avoid binding to complex objects directly.

For more details, refer to the official Blazor data binding documentation.
