# Component Lifecycle
## Keywords
component lifecycle, component-lifecycle

## Description
Blazor components have a well-defined lifecycle with methods like `OnInitialized`, `OnParametersSet`, and `OnAfterRender`.

## Resolution
To handle lifecycle issues:
1. Use `OnInitializedAsync` for asynchronous initialization.
2. Avoid heavy computations in `OnAfterRender`.
3. Use `StateHasChanged` to trigger UI updates.
4. Debug lifecycle methods using breakpoints.

For more details, refer to the official Blazor lifecycle documentation.
