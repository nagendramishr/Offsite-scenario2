Functional Requirements for a Ticketing System

1. Ticket Management
- Users can create new support tickets.
- Each ticket includes: title, description, priority, status, category, attachments, unique ID, and tech area (all text-based).
- Tickets can have statuses: Open, In Progress, or Closed.
- Users can view a list of their submitted tickets in all states.
- Support agents can view, filter, and search all tickets.
- Tickets can be assigned to support agents, and each agent takes ownership of their assigned tickets.
- Tickets can be updated with new information, comments, or status changes.
- Tickets can be closed or reopened as needed.

2. User Management & Authentication
- Users must register and log in to access the system.
- Three roles: End User, Support Agent, and Admin.
- Role-based access control determines ticket visibility and permitted actions.
- The UI is protected by OAuth authentication for all roles.
- Users cannot reset their passwords.

3. Communication & Collaboration
- Users and agents can add comments to tickets.
- Notifications are sent to users and agents when tickets are updated (e.g., status changes, new comments).
- Users and agents can attach files or screenshots to tickets.

4. Dashboard & Reporting
- Users have a dashboard showing all their tickets (open, in progress, closed).
- Support agents have a dashboard showing assigned and unassigned tickets.
- Admins have a dashboard with system-wide statistics and reports (e.g., ticket volume, average resolution time).
- Dashboards update when the user refreshes the screen.

5. Search & Filtering
- Users and agents can search tickets by ID, title, status, or keywords.
- Tickets can be filtered by status, priority, assigned agent, or date.

6. Audit Trail
- The system maintains a history of all actions taken on each ticket (creation, updates, status changes, comments).

7. Security
- User data and ticket information are securely stored.
- The system is protected against unauthorized access and data breaches.

8. Technical Specifications
- Backend is implemented in .NET.
- SQLite is used as the database.
- The frontend is web-based.
- The system is hosted in a self-contained container.
